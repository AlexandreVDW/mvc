# MVC Project

This project is structured into three folders, each representing a different stage of development in an MVC (Model-View-Controller) project.

## Folder 1: Basic MVC

The first folder contains a basic implementation of an MVC project. This is a great starting point for understanding the fundamental concepts of MVC.

## Folder 2: MVC with Namespaces

The second folder takes the basic MVC project a step further by incorporating namespaces. This helps to organize the code and prevent naming conflicts.

## Folder 3: MVC with OOP Router

The third folder introduces an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) router to the MVC project. This allows for more efficient routing and better organization of the code.

Actually is delete because it refuse to work and i need to work more on it

## Why multiple folders?

The reason for having multiple folders is to show the progression of the project. This allows for a better understanding of the MVC project and how it can be implemented in different ways.

Please navigate through the folders to understand the progression and the different implementations of the MVC project.
